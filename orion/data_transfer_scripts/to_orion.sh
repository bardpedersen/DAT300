# v: Verbose mode (command will output more details about what it's doing, such as listing the files being transferred or skipped)
# z: Compress     (compresses the data before transferring it, which is faster)
# P: Progress     (shows the progress of the transfer, and allows you to resume a transfer if it's interrupted)
