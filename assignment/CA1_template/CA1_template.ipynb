    "In this assignment we will continue with the task of classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, used in the voluntary assignment where we designed a neural network from scratch. But, today you will implement the network using the Keras API of the TensorFlow library. TensorFlow and PyTorch are both free open-source software libraries intended to simplify multiplication of tensors, but are mostly used for the design and implementation of deep neural networks. Both libraries simplify the implementation of neural networks, and allow for faster training of networks by utlizing hardware acceleration with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n",

    "TensorFlow was developed by Google Brain for internal use in Google and was initially released under Apache 2.0 License in 2015 [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow). Keras was initially released as separate software library, developed by François Chollet, to simplify the Python interface for design of artificial neural networks. Up until version 2.3 Keras supported multiple backend libraries including TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, and PlaidML [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras). When TensorFlow 2.0 was released in 2019, keras was included as a TensorFlow specific API that is accessible by:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow.keras as ks\n",

    "PyTorch was originally developed by Meta AI (formerly known as Facebook) in 2016, but is now under umbrella of the Linux foundation, and is open-source under the BSD license [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch). While TensorFlow was the most popular framework for a long time, PyTorch has been gaining more and more users in the last five years and is now more used in industry and is becoming more popular in research as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lectures of DAT300 will be taught using the Keras API in TensorFlow, and we recommend you to stick with Keras and TensorFlow for this course as it is easier for beginners to get started with. \n",

    "1. Part 1: Import, preprocess, and visualize the data.\n",
    "2. Part 2: Use the Keras API to implement a Dense Neural Network (NN) that resembles the model given in the voluntary assignment.\n",

    "4. Part 4: Train a Machine Learning classifier that you learned about in DAT200.\n",

If you did not do the voluntary assignment yourself, have a look at the solutions that should be posted and run through the solutions-notebook to get the results you need for a comparison."
